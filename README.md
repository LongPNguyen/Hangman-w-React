This is a simple game of Hangman built using Reactjs.

To start you will need to run "npm install" to download all the node modules

The answers are predetermined and randomized each time the page refreshes, to edit the answers just add or remove from the list on the "seasons.js" file under the components directory. Notice there is a counter under the "Hangman" title, this shows the player the amount of guesses taken as well as the maximum number of guesses allowed. Once the count reaches 6 it's game over.

A virtual keyboard is provided to click on. As letters get clicked they will grey out indicating that they can no longer be picked as one of the guesses.

Once the game is won or lost players are able to reset the game by clicking on the reset button which allows them to play again,
hope you all enjoy this game!
